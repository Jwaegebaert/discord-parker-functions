# Discord Parker Functions

Discord Parker Functions are some basic Azure Functions developed within NodeJs. They are designed to feed our custom Discord app, `Discord Parker App`, with information about the PnP community. Currently, the main information the Parker App receives is all about the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365). This information will be fed to a community bot that in turn will post notifications within the Discord server.

To see him in action you can join the CLI for M365 community Discord server using the invite below.
