# Discord Parker - Azure Functions

The Discord Parker Functions are a set of basic Azure Functions developed within NodeJs. They have been specifically designed to provide our custom Discord app, `Discord Parker App`, with relevant information related to the PnP (Microsoft 365 & Power Platform Community) community. Currently, the primary information that the Parker App receives is related to the [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://github.com/pnp/cli-microsoft365). This information is then fed to a community bot which posts notifications within the Discord server.

To witness the functions in action, you can join the CLI for M365 community Discord server by clicking on the invite link provided below.
